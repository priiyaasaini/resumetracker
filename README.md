# Smart ATS Resume Checker
Smart ATS is a Streamlit web application designed to help job seekers improve their resumes based on specific job descriptions. It leverages Google's Generative AI to act like an experienced Application Tracking System (ATS) and provide detailed feedback on resume matching, missing keywords, and profile summaries.

## About the App
The Smart ATS app takes a job description and a resume as inputs, evaluates the resume against the job description, and provides feedback on how well the resume matches the job description. The feedback includes a percentage match, a list of missing keywords, and a profile summary to help improve the resume.
